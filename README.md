# MMFR LANE 2 – Crypto Trading Engine

A real-world oriented crypto futures trading engine built for **risk-first execution**, not strategy hype.

## Key Concepts
- R-based risk management (intentional risk, no leverage distortion)
- ATR-based dynamic SL/TP
- Daily loss / MDD / consecutive loss circuit breakers
- Exchange-safe order execution (SL/TP separation)
- WebSocket recovery & state synchronization

## What this is NOT
- ❌ HFT system
- ❌ Guaranteed profit bot
- ❌ Signal-selling tool

## Stack
- Node.js
- Binance Futures API
- WebSocket (real-time market data)

## Status
Actively evolving. Built for personal use and research.
